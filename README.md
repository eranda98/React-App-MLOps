# React-App-MLOps

Create a simple app (start with a React app, it is simpler) that has a single page with a form and a submit button. 
After clicking "submit", a message show up to tell the user that submission is a success.

Then, using Selenium, build an End-to-End test for your app that inputs text in the form, clicks submit; and validates that the success message was shown.
Then, export the code of the testing, and add it to your project, configure the project so that when you run the test (using "npm run test"), your test runs and there are no errors.
